  How to split your paycheck so bills and savings happen automatically—and the number in your spending account becomes your real “safe-to-spend.”
---

In the last post, we talked about the philosophy of separate accounts. Today, we’re doing the plumbing.

Most people let their entire paycheck land in one big **bucket**, then try to move it around manually. The Anti-Budget does the opposite:

> **Split the money at the source.**  
> Then only interact with what’s left.

## The “Hydra” Paycheck

Think of your paycheck not as one stream, but as a river that splits into 3 (or more) directions the moment it leaves your employer.

### 1) The Direct Split (Payroll level)

Many payroll systems (ADP, Gusto, Workday, etc.) let you send your pay to multiple accounts. This is the cleanest “set it and forget it” move.

**Account A — Bills**
- A fixed dollar amount goes here  
- Example: **$1,100/paycheck**
- Job: fund the boring stuff before you ever see the money

**Account B — Savings**
- Fixed amount or percentage  
- Example: **$300/paycheck** or **10%**
- Job: emergency fund, down payment, cushion, future stability

**Account C — Spending**
- The remainder goes here
- Job: your **Spend-to-Zero** money (no tracking, no guilt)

If your payroll portal supports this, you’re basically done.

### 2) The “Automated Bank” alternative (Bank acts like traffic cop)

If your employer can only deposit to one account, don’t worry. You can use your bank to do the split.

**Step 1: Pay lands in a Hub account**
- Example: Friday payday → **$3,000** hits the Hub

**Step 2: Recurring transfers run immediately after payday**
- Saturday 2:00 AM → **$1,100** to Bills  
- Saturday 2:00 AM → **$300** to Savings

**Step 3: You wake up and see the truth**
- Your Hub now shows exactly what you can spend

This is the same system — just one step later in the chain.

## The goal: “Safe-to-Spend”

The reason we do this is simple:

> **We want one number you can trust.**

When your bills are already funded and your savings are already tucked away, the number you see in your spending account is the truth.

No mental math at the store.  
No “did rent clear yet?” anxiety.

If there’s **$400** in the account, you can spend **$400**.

That’s the whole point.

## Advanced setup: Goal buckets

Once the basics are running, you can add more “plumbing lines” for things you actually care about.

Examples:
- **Vacation Line:** $50 / paycheck  
- **New Car Line:** $100 / paycheck  
- **Guilt-Free Tech Fund:** $20 / paycheck  
- **Annual Bills:** $40 / paycheck (insurance, memberships, etc.)

It turns big future expenses into small, forgettable deposits.

## Which banks make this easy?

You can do this with almost any bank, but some make it smoother:

- **Ally Bank** — “Buckets” inside savings (easy to separate goals)
- **SoFi** — “Vaults” to separate money visually
- **Capital One 360** — easy to open multiple accounts for separate goals

(You don’t need the “perfect” bank. The system matters more than the brand.)

## Your next step (do this today)

1. Open your payroll portal  
2. Find **Direct Deposit** settings  
3. Look for a button like: **“Add another account”**  
4. If it exists, you’re halfway to a stress-free setup

If it *doesn’t* exist, you still win — you’ll just use the Hub + auto-transfers method.
