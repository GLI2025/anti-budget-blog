  How to use the anti-budget money system to smooth out payments, spending money,
  and your financial stress.
---

We have more options and simpler control of our money in the digital landscape than ever before—yet most of us still feel stressed, behind, or confused by it.

**The Anti-Budget** is my approach to money that prioritizes *clarity and freedom* over tracking every little thing.

Instead of asking, *“Can I afford this?”* every day, you build a system that answers that question **once**, automatically.

## What you’ll find here

- **The Anti-Budget formula**
- **Real, practical examples**
- **A clear call to action**
- **A printable guide you can actually use**

## The one idea I care about most

Money works best when it becomes a *repeatable system*, not a daily reminder of how you could do better.

The Anti-Budget is built around one simple rule:

> **Each dollar should have one job — and one place to live.**

When money is separated *by purpose*, your brain finally gets to relax.

---

## Start with the boring stuff (that causes the most stress)

If you want a starting point, begin with your **regular, non-negotiable monthly bills**.

Example:

- Rent / Mortgage — $1,300  
- Cell phone — $74  
- Internet / Cable — $90  
- Insurance — $145  
- Car payment — $600  
- Other fixed expenses — $___  

**Total: $2,209**

I’m going to assume something important:

> You didn’t take on these obligations without having the income to support them.

That means we’re not here to shame or “fix” you — we’re here to **organize reality**.

---

## Create a Bills account (this is the first real move)

Open a **separate bank account** whose *only job* is paying bills.

Name it whatever you want:
- `Bills`
- `Monthly Expenses`
- `Do Not Touch`

The name doesn’t matter.  
The rule does.

Now take your monthly bills total ($2,209) and divide it by how often you get paid.

- Paid bi-weekly → ~$1,105 per paycheck  
- Paid weekly → ~$552 per paycheck  

Set up an **automatic transfer** from your paycheck or main checking account into this Bills account **every time you get paid**.

This account should:
- Only receive money for bills  
- Only pay bills  
- Never be used for spending  

Once this is set up, your bills are handled **before you ever see the money**.

No reminders.  
No stress.  
No “did I forget something?”

---

## Separate the rest (this *is* the Anti-Budget)

Instead of one checking account trying to do everything, create **multiple accounts with single purposes**:

- **Main Checking / Spending**  
  Guilt-free, spend-to-zero money  
- **Savings / Emergency Fund**  
  For safety, not temptation  
- **Roth IRA / Investments**  
  Long-term future you  
- **Sinking Funds**  
  Travel, car repairs, gifts, annual bills  
- **Fun / Flex**  
  Money you *want* to use  

These can be:
- Separate banks  
- Separate accounts at the same bank  
- Or sub-accounts at a bank that supports them  

The key rule:

> **One account. One job.**

---

## Automate everything you can

The Anti-Budget only works if it runs *without you*.

You have two solid options:

1. **Split your paycheck**  
   Many employers let you deposit income into multiple accounts.

2. **Use a bank that moves money automatically**  
   Set recurring transfers for the day your paycheck hits.

Either way, the flow should look like this:

1. Money comes in  
2. Money gets routed  
3. You only interact with what’s left  

What’s left in your main checking?

That’s your **spend-to-zero money**.

No tracking.  
No categories.  
No guilt.

---

## What about “what’s left over?”

At first, you can let everything left simply be spending money.

That’s exactly what I did.

Later, you can decide:
- “I want $300 per paycheck going to savings.”
- “I want $100 going to my Roth.”
- “I want a travel fund quietly growing in the background.”

You don’t need to do everything at once.

> **Clarity first. Optimization later.**

---

## The real goal of the Anti-Budget

This system isn’t about restriction.

It’s about:
- Smoothing out payments  
- Removing constant decisions  
- Lowering financial anxiety  
- Letting money fade into the background of your life  

When your accounts are separated and automated, money stops being emotional.

It becomes infrastructure.

And that’s the point.

**Next:** I’ll show you how to map this system visually so you can see your entire money flow at a glance.

  

I’ll share what I’m learning, what I’m testing, and the tools we build as we go.
