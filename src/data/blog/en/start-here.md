  What this site is, who it’s for, and how to start using Anti-Budget ideas and tools.
---

If budgeting has ever made you feel behind, guilty, or obsessed with categories, you’re not broken — the system is noisy.

**Anti-Budget** is my approach to money that prioritizes *clarity and freedom* over tracking every little thing.

## What you’ll find here
- **Life design money:** big choices (like why my wife and I think about sailing and what that changes).
- **Hidden costs:** stuff that costs attention, time, and options (not just dollars).
- **Money systems:** simple routines that keep things calm and predictable.
- **Tools:** calculators and worksheets that help you decide, not just learn.

## The one idea I care about most
Money works best when it becomes a *repeatable system*, not a daily debate.

If you want a starting point, begin with this:

- **Once a week:** check your “safe to spend” number.
- **Once a month:** do a 20-minute reset (bills, buckets, one decision).

I’ll share what I’m learning, what I’m testing, and the tools we build as we go.
